## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
### CHAN, Hannah Princess G. || 9 - Na (Na12)

**1. Arithmetic Operators**
Arithetmic operators, as what can be interpreted from its name, are operators that are intended and used for *mathematical operations*. In Javascript, what's nice about arithmetic operators (and what I love) is that if for example, a = 5, b = '5', consider a * b, it will equate to 25 as the variables will be treated as numerical values. Of course, it can also be used if one or both operands are strings (5 + 'Hello' = 5Hello), it just depends on how you'll use it.

**2. Comparison Operators**
Comparison operators are operators that are used to *compare 2 (or more) values*. Most are easy to grasp and understand as these operators are also often used in math such as the greater than or equal to (>=) and equal to (=) operators. Additionally, it is important to note and keep in mind on how to use these operators properly and learn how to interpret them as for example, '==' and '===' can be confused by many (including me, unfortunately).

**3. Variable Declaration**
Declaring variables are usually done at the very beginning of the code and this is intended to be used throughout the entire time (or depending on the scope) so it is crucial that we understand how to do so properly with learning about each variable type's definition and in general its rules. There are diffferent variable types such as *var, let, and const*. Var is used to create and declare a variable, let is like var but the difference ist that it imposes scope constraints and let declared variables cannot be redeclared, and const cannot be changed through reassignment and this remains constant to its scope (global, local) to its declared block.

**4. Data Types**
A data type is a data description, we have different data types and these are *strings, numbers, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol.* The data type string is used for data that contains *text* and wrapped in either double or single quotes while the data type number is used for **numbers** (decimal, whole, negative, etc) but keep in mind that the number can only be up to 15 digits. Boolean returns either *true or false* as its value, undefined shows that there's *no value to an undefined variable*, the value, null, shows that *nothing is represented*. Lastly, the data type, symbol, is described as *unique and unchanging* but this isn't really focused on and disccused further as this is less used and more advanced.

**5. Loop Control Structures**
Loop control structures are handy and convenient to use when we intend to perform an action for a number of times and to present an iterative process. These loop control structures consist of 3 and these are the *while statement, do while statement, and the for (in) loop.* The while statement is a conditional expression enclosed in parentheses after the keyword *while* with its statements just below. On the other hand, the do while statement executes a statement or statements once then continues for as long as it assesses the true value and its expression is the keyword do with the statements below and with while with its expression within the parentheses at the end. Lastly, the for (in) loop will run for all of the object's elements.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  

**1. Nested Loop**
Though I believe that I've understood on how loop control structures work, nested loops tend to be confusing when it comes to interpreting them and on how it works. I tend to get confused on how the outer and inner loops work.

**2. Declaring Functions**
I understand the definitions of how to declare functions. However, when it comes to applying them, it can get confusing and tricky for me especially since I don't know *when* to do so.

**3. Global Functions**
Global functions like parseInt, parseFloat, isNaN are easy to understand through its definitions. However, when it comes to applying them like in exercises, I get confused on how to use them and using them doesn't really come up in mind whenever I code.

**4. Event Handlers**
Using event handlers are nice (and still excites me when it works) since it helps make your website interactive. However, its expression gets me confused and it's quite easy to forget.

**5. Getting Input**
Getting input may seem simple yet I still get confused on how to do so and on how to store this. This can also involve the use of global functions, which I am still confused about.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

**1. Nested Loop**
I will continue to try and understand on how its sequence/order works so that I could understand further on how to interpret and use it. Also, I will continue to understand how the outer and inner loops work through applying them in exercises more.

**2. Declaring Functions**
I will learn to understand on how it works (statements, expressions, lines, etc) so that I could know on how to declare and use them properly in codes. To do so, I will continue to study previous exercises that use functions.

**3. Global Functions**
Since its definitions are easy to understand, what I should focus on is learning how to use and apply them in codes. To do so, I will continue to study previous exercises that use global functions and of course learn how to interpet/analyze them so that I could think of using them in future codes.

**4. Event Handlers**
Since its expression gets me confused and it's easy to forget, I'll continue to throughouly understand them by learning to apply and use them in codes/exercises so that I won't have to memorize it since it won't be as effective as truly understanding its use. Since there are no exercises as of now that use event handlers, I could study my previous codes or even try to "re-do" the codes.

**5. Getting Input**
I will continue to try and learn on how to get input and store this through studying the lessons and previous exercises again. Also, I will learn about the application and use of global functions through my method as mentioned earlier.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### EFFECTIVE

**1. Demonstrations**
I believe that I learn effectively when Sir teaches the code through his own demonstration and also explain as to why it is so. Also, I get to do the code itself while Sir is teaching and it's kind of like hands-on.

**2. Normal Lessons**
I believe that normal lessons also help me since even if it is accessible in KHub, Sir explains it in a more concise way. Also, if there are questions, it can be attended to faster and more effectively.

### NOT EFFECTIVE

**1. Video Lectures in KHub**
Whenever there are suspensions or asynchronous sessions, the video lectures are useful and more convenient for everyone so that it can be accessed and studied with their own pace. However, it wasn't useful to me this quarter since even if I tried to access it, I could not play them. Instead, I read the study/lesson guides and researched whenever I had confusions although the video lectures would've also helped.

**2. Group activities (by table)**
Though this requires to be done by group, there is a high chance that not everyone will work on it and contribute fairly. I'm not saying that this shouldn't be implemented but, I just believe that it isn't as effective as expected.
