`Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting`
* *Teachers will now be paid for teaching workload and overtime.*
* *A lot more will now be covered by DOH [medicine, billings, etc]*
* *Car-free Sundays*
* *More evacuation centers will be established; schools shall no longer be used as evacuation centers.*

`1-3 key points found weird for any reason`
* *Congratulating/recognizing PNP Chief Torre for being declared champion:* **unnecessary**
* *Over 677 of those who got arrested due to illegal drugs were connected to the government? [Police, government officials, etc]*
* *Many flood control projects failed —> corruption, pocketing funds*

`Write 2 paragraphs of reflection`
   *A lot was discussed during this year’s State of the Nation Address and I believe that most that were discussed were okay and showing improvement within our country. However, I also believe that there were some flaws that could’ve been given attention or updates to such as the situation regarding the US Tariffs, online gambling, etc. Additionally, what was discussed and its plans were somewhat difficult to trust—it all felt like stories. I also found what he said to corrupt officials that steal public funds ironic, he said “Mahiya naman kayo sa kapwa niyo Pilipino”—it somewhat felt like man vs. himself.* 

   *Overall, what he discussed was decent and showed compassion towards the Filipino people, especially considering the 3 storms that brought intense flooding, rain, and damage to the country. For me, in the end, it’s still hard to trust government officials, especially Marcos’ administration. “No one shall be above the law.”, so be it, it shall be, for the sake of justice. Regardless of status, wealth, strength, and position—no one shall be above the law and this should be more heard.*

`What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?`
*Weh?*

`Furthermore, include an image or youtube video of the SONA in the .md file`
